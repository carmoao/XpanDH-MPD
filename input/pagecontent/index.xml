  <h3>Scope</h3>
  <p>
    This is the Medicinal Prescription and Dispense HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide for the XPanDH project, created to assist the work of the pilots for the <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/xpandh/index.html#adoption-domains">XpanDH experimentation bubbles</a>.

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <blockquote class="dragon">
    <p>This specification has been created to contribute to the development of the European EHRxF for this domain.</p>
    <p>
      <b>This guide is not intended to replace or override the <a href="https://hl7.eu/fhir/laboratory/">HL7 Europe Medicinal Prescription and Dispense FHIR IG</a> or any other Implementation Guide that will be specified by MyHealth@Eu and/or JA-09</b>

  <h4>Relationships with other guides</h4>
  <p>
    The following figure provides an overview of the general development approach and the relationships of this guide with the HL7 Europe, IHE Pharmacy and other potential HL7 FHIR IGs Medicinal Prescription and Dispense FHIR IGs

  <p>
  This guide has been created to support the development of the  European EHRxF for the prescription domain and not for specifying rules to be used for real systems. Other guides taking advantage of the work of this project are supposed to take this role (e.g MyHealth@EU specification for cross-border services).
  </p>

  <p>A continuos co-creation and alignement work has been established for:
    <ul>
      <li>The on-develop HL7 Europe MPD Guide acts as common parent for any EU guide on this domain</li>
      <li>The IHE MPD defining a global IHE profile</li>
      <li>This guide - derived from the EU one - is used to experiment solutions and rules for being used by the XpanDH communities</li>
      <li>Findings collected and solutions experimented by the XpanDH communities are feedback to the HL7 Europe and IHE MPD projects.</li>
      <li>When specifications are incorporated in the HL7 Europe guide; the associated rules are removed from this guide being inherited from the parent guide.</li>
      <li>This guide is supposed to serve as input for future cross-border HL7 FHIR-based prescription services</li>
    </ul>
